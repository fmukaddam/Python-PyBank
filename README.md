# Python-PyBank
In this task, I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
Data is pulled from a csv file budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

# Steps
<h2> Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following: </h2>
1) The total number of months included in the dataset <br>
2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period <br>
3) The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period <br>
4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period <br>
5) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period <br>


The analysis looks likes this:
Financial Analysis <br>
---------------------------- <br>
Total Months: 86<br>
Total: $38382578<br>
Average  Change: $-2315.12<br>
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)<br>
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)<br>


The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and an exported text file with the results.
